# Intro to IM | 05//231021 : working with "Processing"

## : Creating an artwork or a videogame using functions
For this activity, we needed to use functions to create a simple videogame or a piece of art on Processing. It was my first time coding a videogame from scratch, so I had to keep the interactivity simple and I focused on the codes that we've covered so far in class and in the videos.

For the concept of my project, I chose to create a matching game where the piece is controled with the cursor in mirror effect. I always want my projects to look visually pleasing, so I kept the design minimalist and used essentially primary colors. This gives to the final product an indie and amateur look, and even though my lack of experience with this software didn't allow me to implement all my ideas, I'm satisfied with the finaly product. This assignment really motivated me to keep learning more about Processing to start projects with more interactivity.
