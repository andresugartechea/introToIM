# Intro to IM | 05//231021 : working with "Processing"

## : Creating an artwork or a videogame using functions
For this activity, we needed to use functions to create a simple videogame or a piece of art on Processing. It was my first time coding a videogame from scratch, so I had to keep the interactivity simple and I focused on the codes that we've covered so far in class and in the videos.

For the concept of my project, I chose to create a matching game where the piece is controlled with the cursor in mirror effect. I always want my projects to look visually pleasing, so I kept the design minimalist and used essentially primary colors. This makes the final product look indie and amateur, and even though my lack of experience with this software didn't allow me to implement all my ideas, I'm satisfied with the result. This assignment really motivated me to keep learning more about Processing to start projects with more interactivity.

#### Step 2:
I first coded the piece that's controlled with the cursor. I used *'rect()'* with the arguments linked to the opposite distance of the cursor to create the mirror effect.

#### Step 4:
Then, I drew on a piece of paper the path that piece needs to follow, so I could have an idea of the coordinates of each point.

Instead of using rectangles to draw the path, I used lines augmenting the stroke weight.

#### Step 5:
I wanted the user to understand that they need to follow the path. So everytime the piece is not in the path, everything turns white and only the starting points and the red piece appear on screen. For some reason, when you iniciate the game the size of the green and blue boxes change and I couldn't figure out how to fix that.

However, the problem is fixed once the user starts playing. So I doesn't affect the interactivity that much.

### Final result:
I think that something interesting about my videogame is that it doesn't have any instructions, but it's very intuitive. These are some screenshots of the final result:
