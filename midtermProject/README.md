## Project description:

_"Jump Rope"_ is a game where the player needs to click the mouse every time the rope approaches to avoid touching it. The player scores a point when they perform the task successfully, but the speed increases with every click. The game ends when the ball touches the rope. The scoreboard starts again from 0 so the user can play again and beat their record.

 For this code, I used as reference the tutorial made by professor Allen Toe on his youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIrGAvlNckw&list=PLAE4MzuQm3Gwj2QLcqpepbTuIuzi_18mS).
 To create my game state system, John McCaffrey's tutorials were really helpful (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwQ43aBGz0E&ab_channel=JohnMcCaffreyJohnMcCaffrey).
 He also has a tutorial on how to work with sound on Processing that I used for this project (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6fG1wneXWo&t=63s&ab_channel=JohnMcCaffreyJohnMcCaffrey).
