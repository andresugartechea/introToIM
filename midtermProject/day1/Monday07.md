## Day 1 | Monday 06/07/2021 : midterm Project

## Tasks:

路Work on the concept of the videogame.
路Watch videos with similar playability.
路Start working on the code to have an idea of what the videogame is going to look like.

## Progress:
Today, I started developping the concept of my videogame. I wanted to create something simple to be able to finish the project in time, so I watched tutorials on how to code videogames on Processing. The one that attracted my attention the most was [_"Flappy Bird"_](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/031-flappybird.html), because it used to be one of my favorite mobile videogames.

I want this project to be a challenge for me but at the same time I'm new at coding so I don't want to get lost easily. That's why I decided to use this _"Flappy Bird"_ tutorial as reference to code my own game. Also, I was thinking about recreating a traditional game from the real world that has to do with jump and avoiding touching things as _"Flappy Bird"_ and the jump rope game was my initial thought.

Before coding, I made some drawings to have a better idea of how I needed to start with this project:



## Modifications:

## Problems to solve:
