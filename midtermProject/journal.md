The game must start with a screen giving instructions, and must wait there until a button or key (your choice) is pressed
After the game is won or lost, there must be a way to restart the game without closing and restarting the program

------------------------------------
·Start with a preliminary description of what you intend for your project, followed by a journal of your progress. 
·Each day add the date and then describe the work you plan to do or did that day.  
Include you thoughts, decisions, experiments, etc.  
Discuss what worked and what didn't at the end of each journal entry,   
describe whether, and if so, how, the results of today's work has caused you to modify your plan for your midterm project. 
As always, pictures, hand drawn sketches, pieces of code, etc. can all be used to make your journal interesting and informative.
