## Project description:

_"Jump Rope"_ is a game where the player needs to click the mouse every time the rope approaches to avoid touching it. The player scores a point when they perform the task successfully, but the speed increases with every click. The game ends when the ball touches the rope. The scoreboard starts again from 0 so the user can play again and beat their record.
