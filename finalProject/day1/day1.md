## Tasks:


## Progress:

Arduino sensor "Bob It"

For my final project I want to recreate the game _"Bob It"_ using sensors. I'll be using [Intructable Circuits' Simon says game tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Simple-Simon-Says-Game/) as reference, which has a similar playability.

I'm not sure if this idea is feasible, but for making the task easy I want to use these four sensors which I already know how to incorporate in circuits and coding. I plan on using Processing for the game instructions. The screen will indicate the user what to do and how to use the sensors.
