# Intro to IM | 05/27/2021 : simple work of art

## Self-portrait:
For this activity, we needed to create a self-portrait on Processing.

#### Step 1:
I decided to use one of my photos as reference. Knowing that I could only work with basic shapes, I drew a simple sketch of the portrait to have an idea of how my final result would look like.


#### Step 2:
Then, I began coding focusing on the outline, positioning and sizing. For all the shapes, I wrote the coordinates using the mode "CENTER" so I could use the entire canvas.


#### Step 3:
After this, I worked on the face and started to add details.


#### Step 4:
Placing each form was harder than I thought so I had to keep it minimalistic. I was not fully satisfied with the result because it looked boring and empty, so I put a background to make it look more aesthetic.


#### Step 5:
Finally, I added color to my portrait. For the face, I used the "Fill" tag with "Random" and the blue tone in 255 *- fill(random(255), random(255), 255); -* so the color changes to different shades of blue. I did the same with the background but with yellow color to make it contrast with the face.


### Final result:
Here are some examples of the results that we can obtain with the code:
