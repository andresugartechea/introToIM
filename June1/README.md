# Intro to IM | 06/01/2021 : working with "Processing"

## Create either an artwork or a game using Object Oriented Programming
For this assignment, I used as reference the code from  [*"Defining a Class Part II - Processing Tutorial"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwfOVFelLoo&list=PLzJbM9-DyOZyMZzVda3HaWviHqfPiYN7e&index=35&ab_channel=TheCodingTrainTheCodingTrainVerified) by The Coding Train and the examples seen in my Intro to IM class on [Monday 05/31/2021](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/lectureNotes.md#may-31-2021)

I was having trouble to understand how to work with classes, so I reviewed these examples and used them as frame to create this project.

#### Step 1:
For its concept, I was looking to create two objects that appear and disappear from the screen and cross at a certain point. For this, I first created a class *(Square)* that makes emerge a square and changes of color while moving from top to bottom.

#### Step 2:
Then, I coded a second class *(Circle)* that basically has the same features as the *Square* class, but it makes a circle appear from left to right.

#### Step 3:
I assigned the same speed for both shapes, so they cross at the center of the canvas. I added two squares in the top left-hand and bottom right-hand corners that touch the circle and the square, to make the animation more visually pleasant.

### Final result:
As my previous project, something interesting about my program is that is minimalist but has a good composition, so the aesthetics are good.
